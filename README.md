# ATM Machine Simulation

This Python code simulates basic banking functions such as creating a new bank account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and transferring funds between accounts in Turkish. It's a simple project designed for learning purposes and is one of my first coding projects.

## Features:
- Create a new bank account with a random account number.
- Deposit money into your account.
- Withdraw money, using both the available balance and an optional overdraft (extra balance).
- Transfer money to other accounts.

## Future Improvements:
- Implement additional security features (like password encryption).
- Allow partial use of the overdraft balance instead of consuming it fully.
- Improve error handling and user interface.
